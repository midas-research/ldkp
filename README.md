LDkp (Long Document keyphrase) dataset is the first benchmark corpus of 1.3M documents for identifying  keyphrases  from  long  documents. The LDkp dataset is released in two versions :

 - **LDkp3k**: consists of 0.1M keyphrase tagged long documents, is created using keyphrases from KP20k [(Meng et al., 2017)](https://aclanthology.org/P17-1054/) and their corresponding long document text from S2ORC [(Lo et al., 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.447/).
 - **LDkp10k**: The second dataset LDkp10k consisting of 1.3M long documents along with target keyphrases is created using keyphrases from
OAGKX [(Ã‡ano, 2019)](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-3062) and their corresponding long document text from S2ORC [(Lo et al., 2020)](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.447/).

Since both datasets consist of a large number of examples, we present three versions of training split for both of the datasets with sizes, as shown below:
